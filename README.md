# themoblinskeep

This is the first version of my first developed game. It is a very simple Choose Your Own Adventure game developed as part of a Unity course. Go to link https://dansoberanes.github.io/themoblinskeep/ if you want to play. Keep in mind the game was not meant to be a final polished version and as such does have a lot of bugs in it. Enjoy!
